This repository is a Jekyll-based personal website. Here's a guide to its structure and how to make updates.

### Key Files

*   **`_data/projects.yml`**: This is the "database" for your projects. All project information (name, description, links, images) is stored here in YAML format.
*   **`_layouts/default.html`**: The main HTML template. It defines the page structure, including the sidebar and the content area where project details are displayed.
*   **`assets/js/main.js`**: This file contains the client-side JavaScript. It dynamically loads project content into the main view when you click on a project in the sidebar, without needing to reload the page. It also handles the light/dark theme switcher.
*   **`assets/css/style.css`**: Contains all custom styles for the website, including theme-specific variables for colors and backgrounds.

When editing the web app, be sure to update both the frontend and backend before declaring "success".
